  For each constraint defined for the contract, the contract defines a data
  mapping representing the object or property that the constraint will
  match. Calling #each_pair for an object yields the constraint and the
  mapped object or property for that constraint and object.

  If the contract defines sanity constraints, the sanity constraints will be
  returned or yielded first, followed by the remaining constraints.

  By default, this mapping returns the object itself; however, this can be
  overriden in subclasses based on the constraint options, such as matching
  constraints against the properties of an object rather than the object
  itself.

  This enumerator is used internally to implement the Constraint interface
  for subclasses of Contract.
