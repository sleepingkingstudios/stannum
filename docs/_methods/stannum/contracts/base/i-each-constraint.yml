description: |-
  Any constraints defined on concatenated contracts are yielded, followed by
  any constraints defined on the contract itself.

  Each constraint is represented as a Stannum::Contracts::Definition, which
  encapsulates the constraint, the original contract, and the options
  specified by #add_constraint.

  If the contract defines sanity constraints, the sanity constraints will be
  returned or yielded first, followed by the remaining constraints.
