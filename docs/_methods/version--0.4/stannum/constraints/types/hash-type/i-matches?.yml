description: |-
  If the constraint was configured with a key_type, each key in the hash
  will be compared to the expected type. Likewise, if the constraint was
  configured with a value_type, each value in the hash will be compared. If
  any keys and/or values do not match the expectation, then #matches? will
  return false.
