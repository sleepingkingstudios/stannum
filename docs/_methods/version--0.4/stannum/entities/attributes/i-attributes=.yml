  This method is used to update all of the attributes of the entity. For
  each attribute, the writer method is called with the value from the hash,
  or nil if the corresponding key is not present in the hash. Any nil or
  missing values set the attribute value to that attribute's default value,
  if any. Non-attribute properties are unchanged.

  If the attributes hash includes any keys that do not correspond to a valid
  attribute, the entity will raise an error.
