description: |-
  This method is used to update some (but not all) of the properties of the
  struct. For each key in the hash, it calls the corresponding writer method
  with the value for that property. If the value is nil, this will set the
  property value to the default for that property.

  Any properties that are not in the given hash are unchanged.

  If the properties hash includes any keys that do not correspond to an
  property, the struct will raise an error.
