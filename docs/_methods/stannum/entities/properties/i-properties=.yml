description: |-
  This method is used to update all of the properties of the entity. For
  each property, the writer method is called with the value from the hash,
  or nil if the corresponding key is not present in the hash. Any nil or
  missing values set the property value to that property's default value, if
  any.

  If the properties hash includes any keys that do not correspond to a valid
  property, the entity will raise an error.
