description: |-
  For each defined constraint, the constraint is matched against the
  mapped value for that constraint and the object. If the constraint does
  not match the mapped value, the corresponding errors will be added to
  the errors object.

  Finally, if all of the constraints match the mapped value, #match will
  return true and the errors object. Otherwise, #match will return false and
  the errors object.

  If the contract defines sanity constraints, the sanity constraints will be
  matched first. If any of the sanity constraints fail (#matches? for the
  constraint returns false), then this method will immediately return
  false and the errors for the failed sanity constraint; and all subsequent
  constraints will be skipped.
