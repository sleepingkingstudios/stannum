description: |-
  This method is used to update some (but not all) of the attributes of the
  struct. For each key in the hash, it calls the corresponding writer method
  with the value for that attribute. If the value is nil, this will set the
  attribute value to the default for that attribute.

  Any attributes that are not in the given hash are unchanged, as are any
  properties that are not attributes.

  If the attributes hash includes any keys that do not correspond to an
  attribute, the struct will raise an error.
