  For each key in the attributes hash, the corresponding writer method will
  be called with the attribute value. If the hash does not include the key
  for an attribute, or if the value is nil, the attribute will be set to
  its default value.

  If the attributes hash includes any keys that do not correspond to an
  attribute, the struct will raise an error.
