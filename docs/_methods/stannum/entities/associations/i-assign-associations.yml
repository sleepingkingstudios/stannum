  This method is used to update some (but not all) of the associations of
  the struct. For each key in the hash, it calls the corresponding writer
  method with the value for that association.

  Any associations that are not in the given hash are unchanged, as are any
  properties that are not associations.

  If the associations hash includes any keys that do not correspond to an
  association, the struct will raise an error.
