  The configuration file should be either a Ruby file or a YAML file, with
  the filename of the format locale.extname, e.g. en.rb or en-gb.yml, and
  located in one of the directories defined in #file_paths.

  The contents of each file should be either a Ruby Hash or a YAML document
  containing an associative array, with a single key equal to the locale.
  The value of the key must be a Hash or associative array, which contains
  the scoped messages to load.

  Each file is read in order and parsed into a Hash. Each hash is then deep
  merged in sequence, with nested hashes merged together instead of
  overwritten.
returns:
- description: the merged configuration data.
  type:
  - name: Hash
