description: |-
  For each defined constraint, the constraint is matched against the mapped
  value for that constraint and the object. If the constraint does not match
  the mapped value, the corresponding errors will be added to the errors
  object.

  If the contract defines sanity constraints, the sanity constraints will be
  matched first. If any of the sanity constraints fail, #errors_for will
  immediately return the errors for the failed constraint.
