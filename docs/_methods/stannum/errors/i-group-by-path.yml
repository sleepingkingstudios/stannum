description: |-
  Generates a Hash whose keys are the unique error :path values. For each
  path, the corresponding value is the Array of all errors with that path.

  This will flatten paths: an error with path [:parts] will be grouped in a
  separate array from a part with path [:parts, :assemblies].

  Errors with an empty path will be grouped with a key of an empty Array.
