description: |-
  For each defined constraint, the constraint is matched against the
  mapped value for that constraint and the object. If the constraint
  matches the mapped value, the corresponding errors will be added to
  the errors object.

  Finally, if none of the constraints match the mapped value, #match will
  return true and the errors object. Otherwise, #match will return false and
  the errors object.

  If the contract defines sanity constraints, the sanity constraints will be
  matched first. If any of the sanity constraints fail (#does_not_match?
  for the constraint returns true), then this method will immediately return
  true and any errors already set; and all subsequent constraints will be
  skipped.
